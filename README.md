## Hello, fellow incrementalist.
I'm ‚ùÑ**Snowbank**‚ùÑ(he/him). <br><br>
My username is Neigebank because Snowbank already exists. <br>
I like playing incremental games which is why I'm currently developing one. You'll see that the only repo on my profile that isn't archived is the one I'm working on (Raisematter). I would love to make it an open-source incremental game, but I'm afraid people will say the code is badly written (as I think it is). <br><br>
Chat with me on Discord if you want: Snowbank#7979
